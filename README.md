# Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree Project 2

## Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Summary

In this project, we will make use of Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. And perform data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics. also we will make use of a package that is not part of the standard Python library to help us visualize the data.
